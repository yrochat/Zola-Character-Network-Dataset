This dataset was used for a conference paper at the Digital Humanities 2015 conference in Sydney.

The networks were built with [the method of co-occurrences developed in my PhD thesis](https://github.com/yrochat/phd_thesis) (2014).

This dataset contains:

* The index of character occurrences in the 20 novels (La Pléiade edition)
* 20 character networks based on the novels composing Émile Zola's Les Rougon-Macquart, written between 1870 and 1893

The (undirected) character networks are available as csv files, with three columns: the third column is for the weight (see the [PhD thesis](https://serval.unil.ch/fr/notice/serval:BIB_663137B68131) for more details).

The index of characters is available at the end of La Pléiade edition of Les Rougon-Macquart. It was digitised and corrected so that names are recognisable. Some errors remain, but it doesn't have an impact on the data.

Example of original data:

If you analyse or plot the networks, you will see that they had their characters organised differently from one novel to the next, whereas they were written by the same author.
